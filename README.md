# AntiDebug

## What is this?

A simple terminal interface tool to test Windows x86_64 anti-debugging techniques. Like many of our public projects this was made because we needed it to better explain
some of our [courses](https://haxo.games/courses).

## Build

All this requires is Visual Studio 2022 (minimum) and the "Desktop Development with C++" package installed. The only dependencies this project uses are the Windows API 
and [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI). FTXUI is directly included within the `dependencies/` folder. I'm aware this is bad practice, but I want to keep
the build environment as simplistic and similar to what is used throughout the course as possible for beginners.

## Documentation

In this section I will do my best to document the different anti-debugging techniques used, and maybe add extra details like how they can be avoided etc. For any further
